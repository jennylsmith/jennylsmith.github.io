I worked as a computational biologist in the Research Scientific Computing team of [Seattle Children's Research Institute](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/research/) (SCRI) for the last two years in beautiful Seattle, WA.

I provide collaborative cutting edge computational analysis, as well as providing guidance on utilizing the high performance compute (HPC) cluster to empower researchers to access the computational resources at SCRI. 

A large part of my work includes developing and adapting scalable genomics data pipelines using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) tools.

Previously, I supported pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) translational research studies from the National Cancer Institute's TARGET initiative using genomic and transcriptomic 'big data' from next generation sequencing at [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (FHCC)](https://research.fredhutch.org/meshinchi/en.html).
